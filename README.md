# Coding Challenges

A series of extremely random problems I've encounted on the internet and have decided to take a shot at.

# Challenge #1
Given a function that randommly generates a number between 0 and 1 (uniformly distributed). Calculate the value of PI.

# Challenge #2 (Find intersection)
Have the function FindIntersection(strArr) read the array of strings stored in strArr which will contain 2 elements: the first element will represent a list of comma-separated numbers sorted in ascending order, the second element will represent a second list of comma-separated numbers (also sorted). Your goal is to return a comma-separated string containing the numbers that occur in elements of strArr in sorted order. If there is no intersection, return the string false.
